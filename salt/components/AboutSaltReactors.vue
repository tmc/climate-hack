    <h1>About Salt Reactors</h1>
    <p>
      Salt reactors, also known as Molten Salt Reactors (MSRs), are a type of
      nuclear reactor where the primary coolant, or even the fuel itself, is a
      molten salt mixture. They have been the subject of extensive research and
      they are considered promising technology for future nuclear power
      generation.
    </p>
    <h2>History and Development</h2>
    <p>
      The development of salt reactors began during the mid-twentieth century.
      The concept of a reactor using molten salt as fuel was first proposed in
      the 1950s during the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. Since then, they have
      undergone various design iterations and research, gaining renewed interest
      in recent years.

    <h2>Advantages of Salt Reactors</h2>
    <p>
      Salt reactors offer several significant advantages over traditional
      nuclear reactors. These advantages include improved safety, increased
      efficiency, and the potential for utilizing thorium as a fuel, which is
      more abundant than uranium. In particular, MSRs operate at
      near-atmospheric pressure, reducing the risk of a pressure-related
      failure.
    </p>
    <h2>Challenges and Future</h2>
    <p>
      Despite the promise they hold, salt reactors are not without challenges.
      Material selection, salt purification, waste handling, and fuel processing
      are key issues that need to be addressed. With the ongoing research and
      technological advancements, salt reactors are positioned to be a critical
      part of a carbon-free energy future.
